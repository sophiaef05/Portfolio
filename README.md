Hello! My name is Sophie Fehrenbacher, and I am currently a junior, studying Computer Science at USI. After I graduate with my bachelor's degree, I plan to attend USI for an additional year
to receive an MBA with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. My top career interest is web development, but I am also interested in software development and cybersecurity.

This repository has some of my projects that I have completed during my studies at USI!
